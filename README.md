# CHERT Paper I – Trace: The Resonant Refraction Index

This repository hosts the code, datasets, and visualisation tools used in CHERT Paper I: *Trace – The Resonant Refraction Index: A Harmonic Analysis of Atomic Systems*.

CHERT (Cymatic Harmonic Energy Resonance Theory) proposes that systems across physical domains self-organise around harmonic attractors. This paper introduces the variable **Trace** — a cent-based measure of deviation from harmonic nodes — and applies it to hyperfine transitions in noble gases and biological elements.

The results suggest measurable resonance convergence, statistically distinct from null distributions, with implications for systemic coherence, toxicity, and structural predictability.

## Repository

https://github.com/fieldharmonics/yuruca-chert-trace

## Features

- Trace calculation using a 432 Hz-tuned harmonic grid
- Pulse mapping to musical tones (e.g., G#4, A5)
- Null model generator to simulate random distributions
- Element Scorecard framework including Trace, Pulse, and Friction
- Jupyter notebooks and plotting tools (coming soon)

## Example Usage

```bash
python examples/run_trace_analysis.py
```

Example output:
```
Freq: 432.00 Hz | Octave-mapped: 432.00 Hz | Trace: 0.00 cents
Freq: 457.69 Hz | Octave-mapped: 457.69 Hz | Trace: 100.01 cents
Freq: 4.24e+14 Hz | Octave-mapped: 3087.44 Hz | Trace: 4.77 cents
```
